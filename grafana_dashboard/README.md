# Grafana Dashboards

This directory contains Grafana dashboard configurations for monitoring the EKS Fargate platform applications.

No third-party images or logos are used in these screenshots.

## Available Dashboards

### API Monitoring Dashboard (`api-monitoring.json`)
Monitors the sample metrics application with the following panels:
- HTTP Request Rate
- HTTP Request Latency (95th and 50th percentiles)
- Active Users
- Error Rate
- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Available Replicas

### OpenTelemetry Application Dashboard (`otel-app-dashboard.json`)
Monitors the OpenTelemetry-instrumented Python application:
- Request Rate by Endpoint
- Response Time Distribution
- Error Rate Tracking
- Custom Business Metrics
- Distributed Tracing Integration
- Resource Utilization

### Go OpenTelemetry Application Dashboard (`go-otel-app-dashboard.json`)
Monitors the Go OpenTelemetry-instrumented application:
- HTTP Request Rate with method/endpoint breakdown
- Request Latency Percentiles (95th and 50th)
- Active Users Gauge
- Error Rate Percentage
- CPU and Memory Usage
- Pod Replica Status
- Real-time OTLP metrics integration

## Dashboard Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: 30-second refresh rate
- **Multi-dimensional Metrics**: Breakdown by endpoint, method, and status code
- **Alerting Ready**: Thresholds configured for key metrics
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU and memory usage tracking
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Pod and deployment status
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: OTLP traces and metrics

## Import Instructions

1. Open Grafana UI
2. Navigate to Dashboards â†’ Import
3. Upload the JSON file or paste the content
4. Configure the Prometheus datasource
5. Save the dashboard

## Datasource Configuration

Ensure your Prometheus datasource is configured to scrape metrics from:
- `sample-metrics-app` service
- `otel-sample-app` service
- `go-otel-sample-app` service
- Kubernetes metrics (via kube-state-metrics)
- Container metrics (via cAdvisor)
- OTLP metrics (via ADOT Collector)

## Customization

Dashboards can be customized by:
- Adjusting time ranges and refresh intervals
- Adding new panels for additional metrics
- Modifying alert thresholds
- Adding template variables for filtering
